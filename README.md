This was my wife and I's entry for the Ludum Dare 29 Jam, which took place April 25th-28th 2014. The jam's theme was **Beneath the Surface**.

This game was built using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) 0.9.1.

> It's time to Whac-A-Something!
>
> In this thriller of a game, you play the role of a giant metal hammer sent to crush everything! Hit anything that pops up with extreme prejudice to win!
